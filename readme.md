# Data with Danny - 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the 8 Week SQL Challenge, a collection of real-world SQL case studies created by Danny Ma. Completing these challenges helped me strengthen my SQL problem-solving skills and build a deeper understanding of data analysis across different scenarios.

Full credit goes to Danny Ma — you can find the original challenges [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)
